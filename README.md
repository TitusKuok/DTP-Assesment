Once you extracted this ZIP file, go to the MHWI-ALL-Monster-main folder, open the MHWI-ALL-Monster-Mmain folder inside it(yeah idk why they have same name), take out the MHWI_data.db folder, put it in the first MHWI_ALL_Monster-main folder.
Once you run the program, it will says no such table in database, now open the MHWI-ALL-Monster-main folder and you will find a db file called ghef, delete it then the program works now:)
